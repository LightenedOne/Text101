  storyText: "You decided, ever the wise hunter, to observe your prey for a bit longer.
    The Hinn, wild moose-like beasts, appeared to be lazily lounging by the riverbed.
    You counted 4 males and 3 females, with only one calf. One of the males is closest
    to you, with the others a bit farther North. Easy pickings. \n\nWhat will you
    do?\n\n1. Shoot the closest male\n2. Try and creep closer"
