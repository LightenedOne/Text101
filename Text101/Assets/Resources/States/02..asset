  storyText: 'You give chase, running as fast as your legs could carry you. Swiftly,
    you lept over logs and stumps and tree roots, all with only one goal in mind -
    you had to get more meat. After running for a few minutes, you reach a small clearing,
    inside of which you spot even more Hinn.


    What will you do?


    1. Open fire

    2. Watch and wait'
