  storyText: "Ahead, in the distance, you spot them - a pack of wild Hinn. Your bow
    is ready to strike, your clan ready to eat, and they are depending on you. You
    silently creep forward, coming to a stop under a shaded tree. You raise a finger
    to the air - you're downwind, they can't smell you. \n\nWhat will you do?\n\n1.
    Watch and observe\n2. Take aim at the closest Hinn\n3. Creep closer"
